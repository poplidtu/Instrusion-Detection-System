# Instrusion-Detection-System
Network Intrusion detection model is able to classify a malicious packet into intrusion attack classes based upon the ML Model Prediction. Network sniffer is used to analyze real time network traffic at an interface and parse into NSL-KDD99 attributes. network intrusion detector model predict the legitimacy of the packets with an accuracy of ~94%
